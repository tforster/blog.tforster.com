The VFD Clock is a digital clock that I built that uses an old Russian vacuum fluorescent tube display (circa 1960s) in lieu of LED or LCD. This is what a naked VFD tube looks like: ![image](/files/vfd-tube.jpg)

VFD tubes also differ from LED/LCD displays in that they require a significantly higher voltage to run. The gas inside the tube needs at least 70v dc before it will start to glow which means this was a project that required a little more caution than usual as there is also enough current to cause a serious accident. 

The finished product is currently housed inside a clear acrylic box but I am not happy with it and I'm thinking of alternative housings that better reflect the era of the tube itself.
